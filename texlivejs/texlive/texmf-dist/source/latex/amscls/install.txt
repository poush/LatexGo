===========================================================================

If you have a relatively up-do-date TeX system that complies with the
TeX Directory Structure (TDS) standard, check first to see if there is
an available procedure that will install the package automatically from
a CTAN archive.  Otherwise, installing according to the instructions in
section I below is the easiest method.  See

    http://www.tug.org/tds/tds.pdf

for details on the TDS standard.  TeX Live distributions comply with
the standard, as do MikTeX and MacTeX.

If your TeX system does not comply with the TDS standard, please contact
the provider of your TeX system for details on how to install third-party
TeX packages.

The first step is to identify the TEXMF folder that contains files used
by LaTeX. To do this, look for the file article.cls. If you find, e.g.,

  /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/article.cls

then we will define TEXMF to mean /usr/local/share/texmf (everything
up to the /tex/latex/base part). On a Windows system the file location
will probably be something like

  c:\sw\texmf\tex\latex\base\article.cls

Then we define TEXMF to mean c:\sw\texmf. In the following
instructions, wherever you see "TEXMF" substitute the folder name
determined in this way.

If this terminology does not make sense to you, seek assistance from
a friend or colleague, or from the source that you obtained your TeX
system from, or contact us at

I. Installing the easy way.

1. Download the following archive file:

   http://mirror.ctan.org/install/macros/latexf/required/amscls.tds.zip

2. View the following files to assess the effects of the upgrade on
your system:

  README
  install.txt (this file)
  diffs-c.txt

3. Backup the old version of amscls, preferably by moving it out of
the TEXMF tree.

4. Extract files from the .zip archive using your favorite unzip tool,
setting the extraction target directory to the texmf root directory.

5. To check the end result, you should find that you now have amsart.cls
in the following location

  TEXMF/tex/latex/amscls/amsart.cls

Some TeX systems also use a database to keep track of TeX input files.
If this database is not updated, your TeX system might not find the
newly installed files.  Consult your system's documentation to determine
how to update this database.

6. There are no duplicate files in this archive.  As distributed, the
files in the source/latex/amscls area comprise a complete copy of the
distribution from which all the other files needed for LaTeX processing
can be regenerated if need be.  If you need to conserve disk space, you
could delete the files in the source area, since they are not needed
for normal use.

========================================================================
II. Installing the not-so-easy way.

Download  http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/amscls.zip

Make the following directories, if not already present:

  TEXMF/source/latex/amscls
  TEXMF/tex/latex/amscls
  TEXMF/doc/latex/amscls

Backup your old amscls files if they are installed, preferably moving
them out of the TEXMF tree.

Create a temporary directory and generate documentation files (these
assume a *nix TeX installation):

  - make directory /tmp/amscls
  - unzip -d /tmp/amscls amscls.zip
  - cd /tmp/amscls
  - Run latex on the file amsclass.ins and other *.ins files to produce
    .cls and .sty files
  - Run latex on *.tex
  - [optional] Run pdflatex on *.dtx (technical documentation)
  - move *.pdf and *.tex to TEXMF/doc/latex/amscls
  - [optional] move *.dtx to TEXMF/doc/latex/amscls
  - move *.sty and *.cls to TEXMF/tex/latex/amscls
  - delete /tmp/amscls

Some TeX systems also use a database to keep track of TeX input files.
If this database is not updated, your TeX system might not find the 
newly installed files.  Consult your system's documentation to determine
how to update this database.
